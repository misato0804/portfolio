My previous company organizes the biggest music festival in norther Japan every spring and I was in charge of the biggest stage as a director. From booking artists to management of its budget, which is related to the festival, I took the responsibility. It sounds like a really tough work though (yeah...it did...hahaha), at the same time I got to communicate with so many people with different background. That is my irreplaceable treasure to anything."
